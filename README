# The Malagasy PARGRAM Project

ESRC Project RES-000-23-0505
We have developed a broad-coverage computational lexicon and grammar for Malagasy, an Austronesian language spoken in Madagascar. The grammar was written as a part of the PARGRAM project, a project to develop linguistically sound, large-scale grammars within the syntactic framework of Lexical Functional Grammar. Project Web site: http://users.ox.ac.uk/~cpgl0015/pargram/malagasy.html

## Getting Started

The README files in subdirectories explain how to run the grammar and morphological analyser.
